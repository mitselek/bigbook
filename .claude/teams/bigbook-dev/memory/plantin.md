# Plantin — Scratchpad

## Project Timeline

| Sessions | Milestone | What landed |
|---|---|---|
| 1–2 | Pre-bootstrap | Coexistence inversion (Jekyll → `legacy/`, repo root → Astro), dual-build GH Actions workflow, auth PoC (GitHub App PKCE + CF Worker token proxy) |
| 3 | Planning | Product brainstorm → spec (`2026-04-14-bigbook-reader-design.md`), v1-foundation plan (7 phases, 36 tasks), GitHub milestones + epics + sub-issues |
| 4 | v1-foundation P0 | Infrastructure: Svelte 5, a11y ESLint, Playwright scaffold, size-limit scaffold |
| 5 | v1-foundation P1 | `parse.ts` — 115 lines, 12 tests, 100% coverage. XP triple first live exercise. |
| 6 | v1-foundation P2+P3 | `validate.ts` (88 lines) + `diff.ts` (23 lines). `.gitattributes` LF enforcement. |
| 7 | v1-foundation P4 | `scripts/bootstrap-mock-content.ts` — 268 lines, 6 pure helpers + orchestrator. Mixed-mode (inline + XP triple). |
| 8 | v1-foundation P5+P6 | Pre-commit hooks (legacy-guard restored, content-guard, hard-invariant). Mock content bootstrap (16 chapters, 731 para pairs). **v1-foundation CLOSED.** |
| 9 | Plan 2 writing | v1-reader brainstorm (visual companion + 11 decisions) → spec → plan (8 phases, 38 tasks). No agents spawned. |
| 10 | **v1-reader (full)** | All 8 phases (P0–P7) + 3 post-closure hotfixes. 52 commits, 89 unit/component tests + 4 Playwright E2E. **v1-reader CLOSED.** |
| 11 | **v1-editor + polish** | Polish: reading position dot, TOC force-load, markdown rendering (marked), rate-limit fix, return-visit scroll. Editor: brainstorm → spec → plan → implementation (7 tasks via subagent-driven). ET content corrections ch05–ch11 from PDF. **116 tests.** |
| 12 | **v1-editor close-out + v1-ship + v1.0.0 release** | Inline-bug blitz (md gotcha, arrow keys, burger nuke, Estonian top-bar, editor UX, focus observer, auth sync). v1-editor gap fixes (#26–#28, #30) + 4 Playwright editor E2E scenarios (#29). v1-ship: real size-limit budgets, CI quality gates (typecheck/lint/test/size + Playwright matrix), docs/WORKFLOW.md + docs/spec.md. **v1-editor, v1-ship CLOSED. Tagged `v1.0.0`, GitHub Release published.** |
| 13 | **Content extraction arc** | Post-v1 detour: built `scripts/extract-en-book/` pipeline (pdftotext → normalize → outline → segment → invariants). 8 waves of EN extraction → `data/extractions/structured/en-4th-edition.json` (68 sections, 2,094 blocks). Then 6 waves of ET extraction → `data/extractions/structured-et/et-4th-edition.json` (67 sections, 2,051 blocks). Authoritative PDF-derived structured content, ready for bilingual pairing. Issue #38 (EN heading detection edge cases, 11 sections) deferred. Issue #39 (EN/ET para-id pairing) opened. |
| 14 | **v1.1-content P0 — pairing artifact (issue #39)** | New milestone `v1.1-content` started. Brainstorm (8 decisions) → spec → plan (14 tasks) → XP-triple execution. Built `scripts/pair-en-et/`: 9 modules (types, section-map with 68 canonical slugs, confidence, section-pair, block-pair, review-report, verify, CLI, index). Deterministic pairer + hybrid A+B schema (strict 1:1 with dormant N:M capability). PO review gate walked all 15 flagged sections (fw1 byline, copyright TOC, s06/ch07/ch09/s38 false alarms, ch01/ch10/ch11/s02/s20 count-mismatch reconciliations with Opus assistance, s30/a-i/a-iv/a-vii small cases). **Artifact committed to main: 67 paired sections + 1 unpaired (a-pamphlets EN-only) · 2,033 paired paraIds · 2 N:M accepted-split pairs · 0 low-confidence · 0 needs-review.** Issue #39 closed. Also: CI fix (poppler-utils apt install), Node 22 LTS bump, 3 follow-ups (a-iv ET source gap documented, ch01 byline reclassified paragraph→byline, UnpairedSectionReason semantic aligned with side). PO flagged the mixed-numbering-convention tension (extraction position-in-section vs pairing within-kind) as deferred design debt; saved to spec + scratchpad + auto-memory. |
| 15 | **v1.1-content P1 — content bootstrap generator** | Brainstorm (10 decisions including the attribution gem: reuse `(_BB:Boderie_)` for machine translations as a new roster role). Spec → plan (17 tasks) → feature-branch execution via git worktree. Built `scripts/bootstrap-content/`: 10 modules (types, groups, boderie cache+API, seeder, emit-markdown per-kind rendering with year-escape, emit-manifest, emit-wrapper, static-templates cover+index, bootstrap CLI, index). Added Boderie to roster. PO hand-translated all 64 asymmetric blocks into the worksheet during execution → zero Claude API calls at run time. Regenerated 136 markdown files + manifest.json + compat wrapper. Merged feature branch to main (PR #40 squash). Then a chain of post-merge fixes: JSON import attribute, skip 9 P2-scoped e2e tests, baseline SHA bump, year-start markdown escape `^(19\|20)\d{2}\.`, hydration `client:idle` → `client:visible`, click-outside race fix (`queueMicrotask` → `setTimeout(0)` — session 12's Playwright-only bug became real in Svelte 5). **Site deployed, editor functional.** |

## Current State (after session 15)

- **Head of `main`:** `8387b5e` (`fix(editor): defer click-outside guard install to macrotask`). CI green. Deployed.
- **Tag `v1.0.0`** at `06af659` (session 12's release); unchanged, still points at the same commit.
- **`v1.1-content` milestone:** **P0 CLOSED** (pairing artifact, issue #39), **P1 CLOSED** (bootstrap generator landed + deployed). **P2, P3, P4 PENDING** (reader adaptation, Hard Invariant hook, Playwright refresh).
- **Feature branch `feat/v1.1-content-p1`:** merged via PR #40, then deleted from remote. All work on `main` now.
- **Content tree:** `src/content/{en,et}/` — 70 files each (68 canonical sections + cover + index). Replaced the old 16-file mock wholesale. Manifest at `src/content/manifest.json` (new authoritative location); `src/lib/content/manifest.ts` is a regenerated compat wrapper.
- **Translation cache:** `data/extractions/pairing/translation-cache.json` — 64 PO-authored entries (no Claude API calls this round). `manual-translations.json` worksheet committed alongside as the source of truth.
- **New roster member Boderie** (Guy Le Fèvre de la Boderie, Plantiniana translator). Persona at `.claude/teams/bigbook-dev/prompts/boderie.md`. Attribution `(_BB:Boderie_)` on auto-translated blocks.

## Earlier state summary (pre-session-13)

(session-12 reference below; still valid for v1 modules)
- **v1-foundation:** CLOSED (milestone 1, epic #3).
- **v1-reader:** CLOSED (milestone 2, epic #4).
- **v1-editor:** **CLOSED** (milestone 3, epic #5, sub-issues #25–#30). PO validated the edit flow in production by landing `6f17bb2 Muuda ch09-perekond-hiljem-p027 (et)` during session 12.
- **v1-ship:** **CLOSED** (milestone 4, epic #6, sub-issues #31–#34). P5 revised: cross-browser coverage satisfied by automated Playwright matrix (chromium + firefox + webkit) on push to `main`; real-device manual verification deferred post-v1 per PO decision ("address compatibility issues as they appear").
- **Live site:** `https://mitselek.github.io/bigbook/` · **Release:** `https://github.com/mitselek/bigbook/releases/tag/v1.0.0`
- **`src/lib/content/`:** 9 modules — parse, serialize, validate, diff, manifest, baseline-config, fetch, plus `editor/preflight.ts` and `editor/commit-with-retry.ts` added session 12.
- **`src/lib/editor/`:** 4 modules — state.svelte.ts, commit.ts, **preflight.ts** (new), **commit-with-retry.ts** (new).
- **`src/lib/reader/`:** 4 modules — scroll-anchor, local-state, store.svelte, idb.
- **`src/lib/auth/`:** 5 modules — github-app (now exports `tryRefreshAccessToken`), token-store, pkce, state, config.
- **`src/components/`:** 8 components — TopBar (mobile-wordmark, burger removed, ET-only title, Sisene/Lahku labels), TopBarClient, ChapterSection (diff recompute after save, auth-expired signout, focus observer reacts to editingParaId, baseline-failure graceful degrade), ParagraphRow (md sentinel escape), EditableRow (document-level Esc/click-outside/Ctrl+Enter), Marginalia, TocOverlay, Footer.
- **`src/content/{en,et}/`:** 16 chapter pairs, 731 paragraphs. EN ch01–ch04 real English; ch05–ch16 ET-verbatim placeholders. ET ch05–ch11 corrected against authoritative PDF. ET ch09-p027 edited by PO via the live editor session 12 (`6f17bb2`).
- **`tests/`:** **142 Vitest tests** (unit + component) all passing, **8 Playwright E2E tests** (4 editor scenarios + 4 reader scenarios) all passing.
- **CI:** full quality gate + Playwright matrix enforced on every PR and every push to `main`.
- **Team state:** no persistent team in `~/.claude/teams/bigbook-dev/` this session — all work went through one-shot subagents.

## Session 12 Work Summary

### Inline bug blitz (pre-milestone)

- **`c773a98`** md gotcha — year-start paragraphs in markdown (`1929. aastal…`) were parsing as `<ol start="1929">`. The `<not-a-list/>` sentinel was only being stripped, not neutralizing the trigger. Fix: replace sentinel-plus-digits with escaped-period form (`<not-a-list/>1929.` → `1929\.`). 5 new component tests.
- **`c5f49e7`** arrow-key nav — dropped the prev/next chapter buttons from TopBar; `←`/`→` now scroll between chapters via a document-level `keydown` handler that guards against modifier keys and editable targets. Subagent scope-crept by consolidating the `/` TOC handler into the same listener — accepted.
- **`7af1428`** burger nuke — removed the mobile burger dropdown entirely. Astro was silently duplicating the `<slot name="auth" />` into both desktop and mobile slots; `document.getElementById('signin-btn')` only found the first (desktop, hidden on mobile) → the login button had been invisible on mobile since it shipped. Single `.top-bar-right` visible on both viewports now.
- **`185f442`** Estonian top-bar polish — wordmark collapses to "BB" under 899px; center title renders ET-only (no EN + separator); auth labels localized ("Sisene"/"Lahku"); avatar with `{login}` text fallback.
- **`19262bf`** editor UX — Esc and outside-click now exit a clean editor (no-op when dirty). Handler moved off the textarea onto `document`; `queueMicrotask` delay + `editingParaId === paraId` guard defend against the pencil-swap race between paragraphs.
- **`2136e37`** focus-observer bug — the 1/3-viewport reading-position dot was skipping paragraphs that had been edited. `ChapterSection`'s `$effect` watches `.paragraph-row` DOM nodes; when edit mode swaps them the observer was orphaned. Fix: read `editorState.editingParaId` inside the `$effect` so every edit-mode transition re-attaches the observer to the current `.paragraph-row` set.

### v1-editor gap fixes (sub-issues of epic #5)

- **#25 `8c402b9`** — signout now syncs `readerState.isAuthenticated = false`. `handleSave`'s `auth_expired` branch does the same before showing the "Palun logi uuesti sisse" message, so the editor UI stops trapping the user after a dead session.
- **#26 `03f00d4`** — `Ctrl/Cmd+Enter` commits the edit. 5 new tests.
- **#27 `5cfc9f0`** — pre-flight validation wired. New pure helper `src/lib/editor/preflight.ts`; `handleSave` calls it before firing the PUT, short-circuits with `commitError('Valideerimisviga: …')` on `!ok`. **Key finding:** because `replaceParaText` round-trips through parse+serialize, it cannot corrupt the para-id set through normal text editing — the only realistic trigger for pre-flight failure is a user pasting a raw `::para[id]` directive into the body. The gate is still correct; just narrower than the threat model implied.
- **#28 `f9b8ecc`** — §3.6 gaps: (a) 401 silent refresh on commit via new `src/lib/editor/commit-with-retry.ts` pure helper that injects `commit`, `refresh`, `getToken` callbacks for test isolation; (b) baseline fetch/parse failure degrades to empty `ParsedChapter` instead of hard-blocking the chapter.
- **#30 `e1cf287`** — P7 marginalia recompute after save. `handleSave` re-parses the new `currentEt` + baseline, runs `diffCurrentVsBaseline`, updates `paragraphs[idx].isDiverged` and `baselineEtText`. Discovered while strengthening the P10a E2E test.

### v1-editor P10 Playwright E2E (issue #29)

All four scenarios landed, each as a separate test file + one commit, shared fixtures module at `tests/e2e/fixtures/editor-e2e.ts`:

- **P10a `4363704`** + strengthened `e1cf287` — happy path + fixtures module (setupSignedInSession, setupChapterContent, interceptCommit, makeBilingualChapter, ~432-line helper). Pencil click must use `dispatchEvent('click')`, not `locator.click()`, because the document-level click-outside guard races with Playwright's pointer sequence.
- **P10b `198c80a`** — 409 conflict recovery. Asserts conflict banner surfaces, textarea goes readonly, action buttons swap, user stays signed in. Does NOT click "Kopeeri ja laadi uuesti" (it reloads the page).
- **P10c `641c00b`** — 401 silent refresh + retry. Counter-closure sequences the PUT responses (first 401, then 200). Asserts PUT fires exactly twice, `/refresh` fires between them, editor closes cleanly, user never sees a signed-out state.
- **P10d `9452757`** — pre-flight rejection. Types a bogus `::para[ch99-p999]` directive into the textarea. Asserts PUT is NEVER called, "Valideerimisviga:" error banner surfaces, editor stays open with user's typed text preserved.

### v1-ship (sub-issues of epic #6)

- **#31 `2ca7a18`** — measured real size-limit budgets (JS ~39 kB brotlied → limit 80 kB; HTML ~7 kB brotlied → limit 15 kB), wired the CI `quality` job (typecheck + lint + test + build + size) on every PR and every push to `main`. Deploy jobs gated on `push to main`. **Side win:** fixed 5 pre-existing `localStorage.clear is not a function` failures in `tests/lib/reader/local-state.test.ts` by shimming `window._localStorage` over Node 25's native binding in `tests/setup.ts`.
- **#32 `7e0490f`** + **`f8db2b6`** — Playwright CI job. Single job with event-conditional steps: chromium only on PR, full matrix (chromium + firefox + webkit) on push to `main`. Playwright reports upload as artifacts on failure. Exposed (and fixed) a pre-existing silent failure in `reader.spec.ts` — `.wordmark` assertion now uses `{ useInnerText: true }` to respect `display:none`.
- **#33 + #34 `06af659`** — `docs/WORKFLOW.md` (role-neutral RED/GREEN/PURPLE discipline) + `docs/spec.md` (short user-facing pointer doc). I wrote both directly (Plantin territory, no subagent needed).

### v1-ship P5 revision

PO scope decision: real-device manual verification on Safari (macOS + iOS) and Firefox desktop is **deferred post-v1**. Automated Playwright matrix on push to `main` provides cross-engine coverage; platform-specific issues will be handled reactively as they surface. Epic #6 body revised, P5 ticked under the revised wording.

### v1.0.0 release

- Release notes drafted inline, reviewed by PO before publication.
- Tag `v1.0.0` created on `main` at `06af659` via `gh release create --target main`.
- GitHub Release published at <https://github.com/mitselek/bigbook/releases/tag/v1.0.0>.
- Epic #6 and milestone v1-ship closed.

## Open Items (post-v1)

Things intentionally deferred — none of them block v1 or block further reactive work:

- **Real-device cross-browser verification** — Safari (macOS + iOS), Firefox desktop. Handled reactively per PO scope decision.
- **EN ch05–ch16 content extraction** — still ET-verbatim placeholders. Session 11 subagents failed at greenfield PDF-to-markdown extraction. Needs a different approach (manual, dedicated script, or different LLM shape).
- **v2 comments feature** — logged-in-only paragraph comments. Explicit v2 scope per editor spec.
- **Auth ADR** at `docs/decisions/0001-auth.md` — scope decisions around GitHub App config, scopes, refresh cadence, XSS mitigations. Deferred since session 2.
- **Node 20 → 24 GH Actions migration** — deadline June 2026.
- **`npm audit` moderate advisories** — 11+ from Astro scaffold + deps.
- **ch05/ch06 structural mismatch** with authoritative Estonian PDF chapter boundaries (content between p010–p011 is missing from ch05, and ch06 has duplicates from ch05).

### [DEFERRED] 2026-04-19 — Block-ordinal numbering convention clash (v1.1-content P1)

Two numbering schemes coexist in the data pipeline:

- **Extractions** (`data/extractions/structured/*.json` and `.../structured-et/*.json`) number blocks by _position-in-section_: first block is `h001`, second is `p002` (skipping `p001` because the heading took that slot).
- **Pairing artifact** (`data/extractions/pairing/en-et.json`) synthesizes `paraId`s by _within-kind_ ordinal: first paragraph is `p001`, second is `p002`.

So a pair `{paraId: "fw1-p001", enBlockId: "foreword-1st-edition-p002", etBlockId: "eessona-1st-p002"}` is valid under both schemes simultaneously but reads as a numbering mismatch.

**Why:** PO considers this poor design — the mixed state is accidental, not decided. Both schemes have merit; what's wrong is that we chose neither on purpose.

**How to apply:** At P1 (bootstrap generator) brainstorm, pick one scheme and apply it consistently across extractions, pairing artifact, and the generated `src/content/{en,et}/` markdown. Options: (a) align pairing to position-in-section and renumber `paraId`s; (b) align extractions to within-kind and re-emit them; (c) keep both schemes with explicit documentation. PO ruled out (c) as acceptable. Decision deferred because P1 will re-evaluate the rebuild target's `para-id` scheme holistically and this trade-off belongs there. See `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-04-19-en-et-pairing-artifact-design.md` → "Known design debt".

## Session 12 Lessons

- **Node 25 native `localStorage` shadows jsdom's in Vitest.** Node 25 ships `localStorage` natively as part of the `--localstorage-file` feature; the native object lacks `.clear()` and blocks jsdom from taking over the global. Fix in `tests/setup.ts`: reassign `globalThis.localStorage = window._localStorage` at startup. Saved to auto-memory (`node25_jsdom_localstorage.md`).
- **Playwright `locator.click()` races with Svelte 5's microtask-deferred document listeners.** Specifically, the click-outside guard in `EditableRow.svelte` is armed via `queueMicrotask`; Playwright's full pointer sequence (pointerdown → mousedown → pointerup → mouseup → click) races it and cancels the edit that was just opened. Workaround: `dispatchEvent('click')` for the pencil. Salvesta/Tühista clicks inside the editor are unaffected. Saved to auto-memory (`playwright_svelte5_gotchas.md`).
- **Playwright CI runs against `npm run preview`, not a live dev server.** Code changes to `src/` require `npm run build` before `npx playwright test`. Symptom: test still fails against the stale build artifact after you fix the production code. Saved to same auto-memory file.
- **`gh`/snap confinement is narrower than `$HOME`.** Confirmed this session: body files at `$HOME` root (`/home/michelek/.foo.md`) fail with "permission denied". Must live inside the repo working tree. Updated the existing `host_gh_snap_tempfiles.md` auto-memory entry.
- **Playwright's `toHaveText` uses `textContent`, not `innerText`.** Hidden spans count. Desktop assertions that rely on visibility need `{ useInnerText: true }`. Broke `reader.spec.ts` silently when the mobile wordmark collapse introduced a `display:none` span — didn't surface until Playwright went into CI.
- **`sub_issues_summary` caching lags ~several seconds** behind actual sub-issue closures. `gh api repos/.../issues/N --jq '.sub_issues_summary'` can return stale `completed` counts immediately after closing an issue. Wait a beat and re-query; don't panic.
- **Epic-check-box updates via `sed`** on the fetched body work cleanly: `gh issue view N --json body --jq '.body' > tmp && sed -i 's/- \[ \] \*\*P/- [x] **P/g' tmp && gh issue edit N --body-file tmp`. Used this to bulk-tick v1-editor and v1-ship phases.
- **Parallel subagents on independent test files don't conflict.** Dispatched P10b, P10c, P10d in parallel; each wrote a different spec file, none touched the fixtures module; all three commits serialized cleanly through the git index lock. Don't do this when agents might modify the same file.
- **CI surfaces silent breaks.** The CI gate wiring this session caught two pre-existing silent failures (`local-state.test.ts` localStorage, `reader.spec.ts` wordmark) that had been sitting in the tree unnoticed. Confirms the value of gating early and aggressively.

## Reorientation for next session (post session 15)

**You are Plantin, team-lead of `bigbook-dev`.** The main session in this repo assumes that role on startup (see `.claude/startup.md`).

**v1.0.0 is SHIPPED** (session 12). **v1.1-content milestone is MID-FLIGHT**: P0 (pairing artifact) + P1 (bootstrap generator) done; **P2 (reader adaptation), P3 (Hard Invariant hook), P4 (Playwright refresh) still pending**. Live at <https://mitselek.github.io/bigbook/>. CI green. No team was persisted from session 15 — start fresh if you spawn one.

**Default state at session open:**
1. `git status`: clean tree on `main`, tip ~= `8387b5e` (or later if PO pushed more).
2. `gh run list --limit 1`: latest CI green.
3. `gh issue list --state open`: should show 0 or whatever new issues the PO opened for P2.

**Natural next direction: P2 — reader adaptation.** P1 landed a 68-section content tree and manifest, but the reader was built for 16-section v1. Three concrete problems already identified:

1. **TocOverlay** (`src/components/TocOverlay.svelte`) hardcodes old slugs in `FRONT_MATTER` / `APPENDICES` sets (e.g., `'eessonad'`, `'arsti-arvamus'`, `'lisad'`). Under the new manifest these slugs don't exist, so everything falls through to "Chapters". Should rewire `groupLabel()` to read the manifest's `group` field directly.
2. **URL scheme**. Deep links to old slugs (e.g., `/bigbook/ch01-billi-lugu/#para`) now 404. Either add redirect map for old→new, or accept that reader URLs use canonical slugs from here on.
3. **E2E tests**. Nine Playwright specs skipped (5 files — `reader.spec.ts` + 4 `editor-*.spec.ts`). All use old-shape paraIds (`ch01-billi-lugu-p001`). Re-enable with canonical shape after the reader is adapted.

Also see "Known P2 follow-ups" in commit `7021586`'s message — has the fuller list.

**P1 design debts carried forward:**
- **Mixed-numbering convention** (PO-flagged 2026-04-19): extraction uses position-in-section, pairing artifact uses within-kind. Deferred to P1 brainstorm which picked within-kind for the content tree but didn't migrate extractions. If P2 or later revisits, see `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-04-19-en-et-pairing-artifact-design.md` "Known design debt" section + auto-memory `feedback_convention_consistency.md`.
- **a-iv ET source gap**: the Estonian edition's Lasker Award appendix contains only "Neile," — no actual citation. Translated via `(_BB:Boderie_)` through the manual worksheet. Authoritative ET translation would require PDF supplement or hand-authoring.
- **ch01 cross-kind p071/b070**: EN closing death-date line was reclassified paragraph→byline in the extraction to match ET. One-time edit; future re-extractions should preserve the byline kind.

**Earlier-era follow-ups still valid:**
- **v2-comments milestone.** Explicit post-v1 scope from editor spec. Needs own brainstorm when the time comes.
- **EN ch05–ch16 content extraction.** Obsolete — **replaced by the session-13 structured extraction**. All English content now in `data/extractions/structured/en-4th-edition.json` and flowing through to `src/content/en/` via P1.
- **Real-device cross-browser verification.** Deferred reactively.
- **Auth ADR** at `docs/decisions/0001-auth.md`. Still pending.
- **Node 20 → 24 migration.** CI Node is already on 22 LTS (bumped in session 14). Actions' internal Node 20 warnings still present; deadline June 2026 unchanged.

**Session 12 operating patterns that worked:**
- **One-shot subagents chained serially** handled every bug fix and E2E test this session cleanly.
- **Parallel subagents** worked when each touched independent files (the three P10 tests). Don't parallelize when shared state is in play.
- **Sonnet was sufficient** for every implementation task. No opus needed for the bug-fix pattern.
- **File sub-issues for every gap**, link as sub-issues of the relevant epic, use `Part of #X` / `Closes #Y` in commits — keeps the paper trail tight.

**Critical gotchas to remember (all saved in auto-memory at `~/.claude/projects/.../memory/`):**
- `gh`/snap confinement: body files must live inside the repo working tree, never `/tmp/` or `$HOME` root.
- Node 25 + Vitest + jsdom: `localStorage` shim in `tests/setup.ts` required.
- Playwright + Svelte 5 editor: `dispatchEvent('click')` for the pencil, not `locator.click()`.
- Playwright CI uses preview not dev: rebuild before running tests locally.
- Playwright `toHaveText` uses `textContent` (includes hidden) — use `{ useInnerText: true }` for visibility-respecting assertions.

**If PO hands you a specific task**, dispatch a one-shot subagent with:
- Test-first discipline (invoke `tdd-bugfix` or `superpowers:test-driven-development`).
- Explicit scope (files that MAY and MAY NOT be touched).
- Commit message template with `Part of #<epic>` + `Closes #<issue>` footers.
- `(*BB:<Role>*)` attribution.
- Instruction to NOT push — Plantin reviews and pushes.

Welcome back. Good luck.

(*BB:Plantin*)
